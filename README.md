<strong>A professional solution for centralized OpenJDK distributions management
</strong>
</div>

---

Jenvy is a command-line application designed to simplify the installation, management, and switching between different versions of OpenJDK on Windows systems. The tool supports major public providers (Adoptium, Azul Zulu, BellSoft Liberica) and private enterprise repositories.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** This is a personal and independent open source project. I am not affiliated with Oracle Corporation or its products. Jenvy is a management tool for third-party OpenJDK distributions and does not include, distribute, or modify any Oracle software.

```

---

## Usage Guide

### Exploring Available Versions

```bash
# Display versions from default provider (Adoptium)
jenvy remote-list

# Explore specific providers
jenvy remote-list --provider=azul
jenvy remote-list --provider=liberica
jenvy remote-list --provider=private

# Advanced filters
jenvy remote-list --lts-only          # Only Long Term Support versions
jenvy remote-list --major-only        # Only major versions
jenvy remote-list --latest            # Only the latest versions
jenvy remote-list --all               # All versions from all providers
```

### Download and Installation

```bash
# Download a specific version
jenvy download 21

# The system will automatically ask if you want to extract the archive:
# [?] Do you want to extract the archive now? (Y/n):
# - Y/y/Enter: Immediate automatic extraction
# - n/N: Download only, manual extraction later

# Manual extraction of already downloaded archives
jenvy extract JDK-21.0.1+12
```

### Managing Installed Versions

```bash
# Display installed versions
jenvy list

# Activate a specific version (requires admin privileges)
jenvy use 21


### Private Repository Administration
```

### Private Repositories

```bash
# Configure private repository
jenvy configure-private https://repository.company.com/jdk YOUR_TOKEN

# Display current configuration
jenvy config-show

# Reset configuration
jenvy config-reset
```

### Removal and Maintenance

```bash
# Remove specific version
jenvy remove 17

# Complete removal (with security confirmation)
jenvy remove --all

# Repair system variables
jenvy fix-path
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Private Repositories

The system supports two configuration modes for private repositories:

#### Configuration File

Path: `%USERPROFILE%\.jenvy\config.json`

```json
{
    "private": {
        "endpoint": "https://repository.company.com/api/jdk",
        "token": "your-auth-token"
    }
}
```

#### Environment Variables

```bash
set JENVY_PRIVATE_ENDPOINT=https://repository.company.com/api/jdk
set JENVY_PRIVATE_TOKEN=your-auth-token
```

### Private Repository API Structure

The system requires private repositories to expose a REST endpoint that returns a JSON array with available JDK versions. The endpoint can support authentication via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

#### Endpoint Specification

**URL:** `GET {endpoint}/api/jdk` or configured endpoint  
**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer {token}`  
**Content-Type:** `application/json`

#### JSON Response Format

```json
[
    {
        "version": "11.0.21",
        "download": "https://repository.company.com/private-jdk/openjdk-11.0.21.zip",
        "os": "windows",
        "arch": "x64",
        "lts": true
    },
    {
        "version": "17.0.15",
        "download": "https://repository.company.com/private-jdk/openjdk-17.0.15.zip",
        "os": "windows",
        "arch": "x64",
        "lts": true
    },
    {
        "version": "21.0.7",
        "download": "https://repository.company.com/private-jdk/openjdk-21.0.7.zip",
        "os": "windows",
        "arch": "x64",
        "lts": true
    },
    {
        "version": "22.0.2",
        "download": "https://repository.company.com/private-jdk/openjdk-22.0.2.zip",
        "os": "windows",
        "arch": "x64",
        "lts": false
    }

#### Server Implementation Example

```javascript
// Node.js/Express endpoint example
app.get("/api/jdk", authenticateToken, (req, res) => {
    const jdkVersions = [
        {
            version: "11.0.21",
            download:
                "https://repository.company.com/private-jdk/openjdk-11.0.21.zip",
            arch: "x64",
            lts: true,
        },
        // ... other versions
    ];

    res.json(jdkVersions);
});

function authenticateToken(req, res, next) {
    const authHeader = req.headers["authorization"];
    const token = authHeader && authHeader.split(" ")[1];

    if (!token || !isValidToken(token)) {
        return res.sendStatus(401);
    }

    next();
}
```

## Windows Privilege Management

### Automatic UAC Elevation

The `jenvy use` command automatically requests privilege elevation through Windows UAC dialog to:

-   Modify the `JAVA_HOME` system variable
-   Update the `PATH` system variable
-   Ensure persistence of changes for all users

**Operational flow:**

1. Execute command `jenvy use <version>`
2. Automatic privilege elevation request
3. User confirmation via UAC dialog
4. Apply changes with administrative privileges
